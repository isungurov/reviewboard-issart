=====================================
Review Board 1.5 Beta 1 Release Notes
=====================================

**Release date**:


This release follows Review Board 1.1 Alpha 2. Due to the extensive feature
list in the 1.1/1.5 release, we decided 1.5 would be more appropriate.


New Features
============

* Move detection in the diff viewer.

  The diff viewer now indicates when a block of code has moved from one
  location to another. Previously, if code had moved, the diff viewer would
  only show inserts and deletes, leaving it unclear as to whether code was
  changed during the move. Now, these regions contain special tags on the
  side that indicate where the line was moved to. Clicking on these tags
  will jump to the source or destination for that particular line, briefly
  highlighting the line.

  This was a Google Summer of Code 2009 project by Eduardo Felipe Castegnaro.

* Function/class headers for collapsed regions in the diff viewer.
  (:bug:`114`)

  The diff viewer will now show function or class information for collapsed
  regions. These are also shown in the parts of the diff commented on in the
  review request page and HTML e-mails.

  The functions/classes shown are the closest ones found to the collapsed
  region, and as much may not be exactly where the code in the region lives,
  but should serve as a good guide as to where the code is in the file.

  Support for function/class headers exists for C, C++, C#, Objective-C,
  Java, JavaScript, Perl, PHP, Python, and Ruby files.

* Support for private GitHub repositories.

  We now have a new Hosting Type in the Repository configuration page for
  private GitHub repositories. Simply select :guilabel:`GitHub (Private)`
  to configure Review Board to access your private repository.

  This requires an API token, which can be found on the GitHub user account
  page.

* Improved error reporting in Git.

  If a diff upload failed for whatever reason, there was no log information
  provided to show what had gone wrong. Now we log the reason for the
  failure in the log file.

  We also log any errors with accessing a Git repository, which may help
  diagnose some problems.

* Improved error reporting in Subversion.

  We now log attempts to access information on a Subversion repository, as
  well as any error information when accessing the repository fails.


Performance Improvements
========================

* Improved performance in the diff viewer.

  Some work was done to improve performance in the diff viewer. The
  performance gains for small or medium files may only be milliseconds or
  microseconds, but it can add up for larger files.

* Sped up loading of the dashboard.

  The dashboard made many more SQL queries than were necessary. Much of the
  information (such as a submitter's information) was queried per-row instead
  of once per submitter, and some columns performed their own SQL queries
  per-row. This has now been greatly optimized and sped up to use the minimum
  number of SQL queries needed for all the information displayed.


Bugs Fixed
==========

* The New Review Request page was broken in alpha 2, and is now fixed. Based
  on a patch by Ryan Oblak. (:bug:`1401`)

* The diff viewer should now always show utf-8 strings, regardless of the
  repository encoding. (:bug:`1409`)

* Fixed an Index Out Of Range error with Subversion repositories when the
  last file in a diff was empty. Patch by Simon Morley. (:bug:`1402`)

* Depending on how the recaptcha Python module was installed, Review Board
  couldn't properly detect it. We now detect it properly.

* Fixed exceptions during error reporting for Git and Subversion.
